 ** This is a small portfolio project that I have started on Saturday (Today is wednesday) on my free time, there are a lot of things that could be done better I know but that will be done in a private repository :) 

# What is this ? 

Recently, I made the decision to create my portfolio, but I found myself uncertain about where to begin. However, I had a clear vision of what I wanted to showcase: my coding proficiency, aptitude for learning, and adaptability to various technological environments. With this objective in mind, I embarked on a search for ideas and even sought advice from ChatGPT. Many suggestions pointed towards an ecommerce project, which undeniably serves as an effective demonstration of one's abilities. However, I sought a challenge beyond the conventional path. Therefore, I decided to implement the core functionality of an ecommerce application with a unique twistâ€”it functions as an auction house.

# How much it took me to learn go and code this?

I collected some stats to show how fast ... or slow? I am :)
A lot of time was spend doing some refactors and trying some stuff but I feel a lot more familiar with these technologies now.
